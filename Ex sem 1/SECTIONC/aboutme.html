<h2>Education Background</h2>
<p>I am recently studying from Women In Technology Uganda, where I am persuing a Diploma in computer science. 
The school is giving me passion for my course because the lectures are giving much attention to us. They make sure that 
 in case of any problem my academics, they are available to solve. I finished my A' level from my lovely school
Boniconcilii Girls Voc SS Kyabirukwa. I attended my O'level from the most desciplined school, St. Theresa Girls 
Voc SS Ibanda. The school was desciplined and so prayful. I then attended my primary school from St. Joseph's primary 
School Kyabirukwa, where I was taught how to speak English</p>

            <h4 style="text-align: center;">During Studies</h4>
            <p>
            I experienced a lot during my Education. During my primary, I started P.1 class at Ruhoko, and when I reached
P.3 getting promoted to P.4 class, I was changed and taken in a beautiful school Kyabirukwa, where I was demoted back to P.3 because 
I didn't know how to speak English. I admitted to repeat a class, and I managed to perfom well at the end of primary level.
From rimary, I went to  secondary School, Where all was smooth. I am recently Persuing a course in Computer Science.
I am happily doing Coding. As you see in the above picture.
